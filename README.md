### Hi there 👋

- 💼 Principal AI Researcher at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) — **tech lead of Together AI Inference Stack**.
- 🧑‍💻 I have **initiated and led** the end-to-end DeepSeek V3/R1 effort on [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) — from [day-0 support](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/releases/tag/v0.4.1) and [performance optimization](https://nebius.com/customer-stories/sglang) to [large-scale EP deployment](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-05-05-large-scale-ep/) and [GB200 NVL72 integration](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-06-16-gb200-part-1/) — driving roadmap, coordination, and execution across community collaborations that pushed the frontier of open-source inference engines.

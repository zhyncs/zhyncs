### Hi there 👋

- 💼 Principal AI Researcher at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) — **creator and lead of TGL**, the company’s proprietary inference engine.
- 🧩 My journey with [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) has evolved from one of the first core developers, to leading [inference optimization efforts](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/7736), and eventually taking on a core maintainer role to support its next phase of growth.
- 🧑‍💻 I have **initiated and led** the end-to-end DeepSeek V3/R1 effort on SGLang — from [day-0 support](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/releases/tag/v0.4.1) and [performance optimization](https://nebius.com/customer-stories/sglang) to [large-scale EP deployment](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-05-05-large-scale-ep/) and [GB200 NVL72 integration](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-06-16-gb200-part-1/) — driving roadmap, coordination, and execution across community collaborations that pushed the frontier of open-source inference engines at the time.
- 🎤 Interviewed by The New York Times ([Article 1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html), [Article 2](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/deepseek-owner-china-ai.html)), Featured speaker at [AI Engineer World's Fair 2025](https://wf2025.ai.engineer/worldsfair/2025), [AMD AI DevDay 2025](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/amd-ai-dev-day.html) and [PyTorch Conference 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/pytorch-conference).
- 📚 Co-author of the [FlashInfer](https://mlsys.org/virtual/2025/poster/3259) paper (MLSys 2025 Best Paper) and committer to [FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer). Previously, I was Lead Software Engineer at Baseten (co-authored the [DeepSeek V3](https://www.baseten.co/blog/private-secure-deepseek-r1-in-production-in-us-eu-data-centers/) and [Qwen 3](https://www.baseten.co/blog/day-zero-benchmarks-for-qwen-3-with-sglang-on-baseten/) launches) and led [CTR GPU inference](https://tech.meituan.com/2022/03/03/ctr-gpu-inference.html) and [vector retrieval](https://tech.meituan.com/2024/04/11/gpu-vector-retrieval-system-practice.html) system development at Meituan.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¼ Principal AI Researcher at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) â€” **creator and lead of TGL**, the companyâ€™s proprietary inference engine.
- ðŸ§© My journey with [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) has evolved from one of the first core developers, to leading [inference optimization efforts](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/7736), and eventually taking on a core maintainer role to support its next phase of growth. I have led major releases and technical blogs, such as [Llama 3](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-07-25-sglang-llama3/), [DeepSeek V3](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/releases/tag/v0.4.1), [Large Scale EP](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-05-05-large-scale-ep/), and [GB200 NVL72](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-06-16-gb200-part-1/).
- ðŸ“š Co-author of the [FlashInfer](https://mlsys.org/virtual/2025/poster/3259) paper (MLSys 2025 Best Paper) and committer to [FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer). Previously, I was Lead Software Engineer at Baseten (co-authored the [DeepSeek V3](https://www.baseten.co/blog/private-secure-deepseek-r1-in-production-in-us-eu-data-centers/) and [Qwen 3](https://www.baseten.co/blog/day-zero-benchmarks-for-qwen-3-with-sglang-on-baseten/) launches) and led [CTR GPU inference](https://tech.meituan.com/2022/03/03/ctr-gpu-inference.html) and [vector retrieval](https://tech.meituan.com/2024/04/11/gpu-vector-retrieval-system-practice.html) system development at Meituan.
